# testprojects
various mockups/test code as i learn HTML/CSS/Javascript

I'm struggling to get rid of the blank space between the .discountcode .discounttext area and the area with the logo and DYNAMIC BEADWORKS title

Any help for this super new beginner would be appreciated! (I've only been self-learning for a few days now, an hour or 2 a day).
